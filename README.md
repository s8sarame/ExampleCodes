NaiveBayes: A naive Bayes classifier is a simple classifier based on the application of Bayes’ theorem and the
(naive) assumption of independence among all features.
Implemented and evaluated such a classifier on the basis of two artificial datasets that relate
100 discrete features (for simplicity) to a boolean outcome. 

Cliques and Network Evolution: Biological protein–protein–interaction (PPI) networks can change over time. 
Cliques are sub–networks that are fully connected, meaning every node in a clique has an edge to
every other node in the same clique. 

PCA:  a program that applies the PCA technique to the toy dataset (“pca toy.txt”).
