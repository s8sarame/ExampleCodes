NaiveBayes: A naive Bayes classifier is a simple classifier based on the application of Bayes’ theorem and the
(naive) assumption of independence among all features.
Implement and evaluated such a classifier on the basis of two artificial datasets that relate
100 discrete features (for simplicity) to a boolean outcome. In our case, imagine that the features
describe properties derived from a pair of proteins (co-expression, genomic distance, etc.) that
may tell us if they interact with each other and form a complex.

Cliques and Network Evolution: Biological protein–protein–interaction (PPI) networks can change over time. 
Cliques are sub–networks that are fully connected, meaning every node in a clique has an edge to
every other node in the same clique. 

PCA:  a program that applies the PCA technique to the toy dataset (“pca toy.txt”).
